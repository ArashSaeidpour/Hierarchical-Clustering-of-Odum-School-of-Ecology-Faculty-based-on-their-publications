"A History of Sea Turtle Tagging and Monitoring on Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA","Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) account for almost all nesting activity on Jekyll Island’s beaches, however, the island also serves as a nesting beach for two other sea turtle species, the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and green (Chelonia mydas). In 1958, Caldwell et al. (1962) initiated a multi-year tagging study of loggerhead sea turtles on Jekyll Island, although Jekyll Island has been reported as a rookery for nesting sea turtles since the 1930s. Consistent monitoring of the nesting population of loggerhead sea turtles on Jekyll Island began in 1972. The initial goal of the long-term study was primarily to compare the nesting ecology of loggerheads on Jekyll Island with that of loggerheads on other islands in the area, such as Little Cumberland Island, which started sea turtle monitoring in 1964. Over the past 40 years, the Jekyll Island Sea Turtle Project (JISTP) has undergone many changes in management, effort, funding, methodology, and overall focus. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of those transitions, identifying key lessons learned from Jekyll Island that may be beneficial to sea turtle conservation, research, and management regionally and worldwide."
Improved female abundance and reproductive parameter estimates through subpopulation-scale genetic capture-recapture of loggerhead turtles,"Nest counts are often used as indices for nesting female abundance in marine turtle monitoring, but accurately interpreting nest count trends requires context on the scale of demographic connectivity and estimates of reproductive parameters. Weak nest site fidelity (NSF) relative to the scale of tagging effort may bias parameter estimates. The reproductive ecology of Northern Recovery Unit (NRU) loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) was assessed through subpopulation-scale genetic capture-recapture via clutch sampling from approximately 1000 km of coastline from Georgia to Maryland, USA (30.75–38.06°N and 75.24–81.45°W). Of 20,682 clutches recorded from 2010 to 2012, 20,222 sampled clutches were assigned to 5684 unique females through microsatellite genotyping. Approximately 73% of females detected laying multiple clutches deposited them within a 20-km span, suggesting the possibility of demographic structuring across NRU rookeries that warrants further investigation. Estimated clutch frequencies (ECF) generated from open robust design modeling were 4.28 (4.02–4.54) in 2010, 4.63 (4.45–4.80) in 2011, and 4.57 (4.28–4.77) in 2012, and were significantly higher than observed clutch frequencies. ECF generated from single-island data were biased low by 23–50% relative to those from regional genetic tagging. Among females that nested at least once on a physical tagging beach, 54% also nested elsewhere, with 81% of these “permanently” emigrating during the nesting season. This pattern of relatively strong NSF, but distributed across multiple nearby islands, confounded modeling of detection in single-island datasets and highlights the need for regional coverage for generating robust estimates of demographic parameters for marine turtles"
"Factors Influencing the Abundance of American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) on Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA","Long-term management of American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) populations necessitates a more detailed understanding of the species' ecology in human-dominated areas. We conducted a 3-yr monitoring program of American Alligators on Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA, to investigate seasonal fluctuations in abundance and the abiotic and biotic (habitat) factors influencing American Alligator abundance in human-made stormwater lagoons. We conducted monthly daytime and evening spotlight surveys from April 2011 to September 2014. Spotlight counts yielded more accurate estimates of abundance. We observed American Alligators using human-made stormwater lagoons throughout the year; however, we observed significantly fewer individuals in the winter season (November–February) than in the mating (March–June) and nesting (July–October) seasons. We collected data on lagoon salinity, lagoon area, percentage of shoreline vegetation, and distance to nearest lagoon. We used the second-order Akaike Information Criterion with a correction for finite sample sizes and subsequent model averaging techniques to examine the relationship between these factors and American Alligator abundance. We found lagoon area to be the most important predictor of abundance relative to the other three independent variables. Salinity was negatively related to American Alligator abundance. Vegetation and distance to nearest lagoon were significant and positively correlated, although ranked lower in our abundance models. Elucidation of these biological trends will allow land managers to better predict when and where human–alligator encounters may occur. In addition, these data may provide developers with valuable information on how to construct stormwater lagoons to promote or discourage lagoon colonization by American Alligators."
Benefits and biases of VHF and GPS telemetry: A case study of American alligator spatial ecology,"American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) historically occupied freshwater habitats such as isolated wetlands, lakes, rivers, bottomland swamps, and floodplains in coastal and inland sites. As a result of loss of aquatic habitats, alligators have adapted to inhabiting human‐made lagoons on golf courses and aquatic habitats in close proximity to developed areas. We conducted a telemetry study of adult (>1.8‐m) male alligators between July 2012 and September 2014 on Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of using very‐high‐frequency (VHF) and Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry in the framework of understanding the spatial ecology of American alligators in a developed landscape. We present both benefits and biases of using these technologies in studies with large, semiaquatic vertebrates. Global Positioning System telemetry produced larger 100% minimum convex polygon home range sizes (range = 67.0–1,094.0 ha) when compared with VHF telemetry (range = 27.5–596.0 ha). Data collected using a prototype GPS technology custom developed by Advanced Telemetry Systems (ATS, Isanti, MN, USA) allowed for the construction of larger, more biologically accurate home ranges. However, VHF telemetry allowed alligators to be detected in underground habitats where they could not be detected with GPS telemetry and yielded more information on behavior and microhabitat through direct observation. We recommend the use of traditional VHF telemetry to allow researchers to directly observe animal behaviors such as reproduction and foraging in conjunction with GPS telemetry to capture previously unavailable locational data. These data highlight the importance of choosing the appropriate telemetry technology based on habitat type, species, and research objectives. © 2016 The Wildlife Society."
Evaporative Water Loss Rates of Four Species of Aquatic Turtles from the Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States,"Many isolated wetlands in the southeastern United States are naturally ephemeral, productive habitats that can support a high diversity of aquatic reptiles. As wetlands begin to dry, reptile species exhibit different behavioral responses including overland dispersal and terrestrial aestivation. Regardless of strategy, one of the greatest risks to individual survival is desiccation. We measured evaporative water loss rates (EWL; % body mass lost per hour) and total % body mass lost over 24 h in four species of semiaquatic turtles that frequent isolated wetlands in the southeastern United States: Chicken Turtles (Deirochelys reticularia), Eastern Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum), Common Musk Turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), and Yellow-Bellied Sliders (Trachemys scripta scripta). Mean percent body mass lost over 24 h ranged from 4.44–10.26% among individuals, was negatively correlated with body mass and varied among species, with higher EWL rates occurring in species with reduced shell robustness (the amount of the body covered by the shell). Mean EWL rates were highest in S. odoratus, lowest in K. subrubrum, and intermediate in D. reticularia and T. scripta. The EWL rates corresponded to species' natural history traits and behavioral adaptations to drought. Species with higher EWL rates could be more vulnerable to increased drought duration and frequency resulting from either climate change or anthropogenic modification of wetland hydrology, and easily measured traits such as shell robustness and body mass may be useful in predicting EWL rates and desiccation risk for particular age classes and other species of turtles."
Teaching Tolerance? Effects of Conservation Education Programs on Wildlife Acceptance Capacity for the American Alligator,"Growing populations of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in human-dominated landscapes present a challenge to wildlife managers concerned with promoting coexistence between humans and alligators. Where structural fixes such as direct removal of animals are not viable options, cognitive fixes such as conservation education programs should be considered. We evaluated the effectiveness of two conservation education programs (classroom-based program, field excursion) on three outcome variables that help define wildlife acceptance capacity for American alligators: beliefs and attitudes, perceived risk, and potential for coexistence. We found respondents who took part in both education programs had more positive beliefs and attitudes toward alligators, and believed in a greater potential for coexistence than individuals in a control group who did not undergo either intervention. Control group respondents also perceived higher risk from alligators. These data suggest that conservation education programs can impact stakeholder beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions, ultimately influencing acceptance capacity for predators."
Drivers' attitudes toward wildlife‐vehicle collisions with reptiles and other taxa,"Wildlife‐vehicle collisions threaten most wildlife taxa as road and traffic densities increase across landscapes. While the biophysical effects of roads on wildlife are well‐studied, research on psychosocial factors that influence wildlife‐vehicle collisions remains sparse. Road characteristics and species behavior are often used to estimate the frequency of collisions, but drivers' attitudes and intentions toward striking animals may put persecuted species at an elevated risk. To inform management and education of road impacts to wildlife, especially reptiles, we surveyed patrons of Jekyll Island (JI), Georgia, USA: to (1) measure their degree of concern for broad impacts of wildlife‐vehicle collisions; (2) gauge their degree of disfavor with hitting animals of different taxa with a vehicle; (3) understand specific predictors influencing attitudes toward hitting deer, turtles and snakes. Respondents were more concerned with personal safety and impacts to wildlife than damage to vehicles. They were most upset with collisions involving large mammals (bears and deer), domesticated animals (dogs and cats) and turtles, and they were least upset with hitting snakes. Respondents that showed concern for wildlife and had visited JI nature centers were more likely to be upset with hitting each taxa. Our results support previous psychosocial findings regarding negative attitudes toward snakes but additionally demonstrate that these attitudes can remain alongside positive attitudes toward other taxa, such as mammals and turtles. These findings can inform our ability to predict the frequency of wildlife‐vehicle collisions and tailor conservation messages toward taxa when negative attitudes exist."
Use of the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index as an Assessment Tool for Reptiles and Amphibians: Lessons Learned.,"Climate change threatens biodiversity globally, yet it can be challenging to predict which species may be most vulnerable. Given the scope of the problem, it is imperative to rapidly assess vulnerability and identify actions to decrease risk. Although a variety of tools have been developed to assess climate change vulnerability, few have been evaluated with regard to their suitability for certain taxonomic groups. Due to their ectothermic physiology, low vagility, and strong association with temporary wetlands, reptiles and amphibians may be particularly vulnerable relative to other groups. Here, we evaluate use of the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to assess a large suite of herpetofauna from the Sand Hills Ecoregion of the southeastern United States. Although data were frequently lacking for certain variables (e.g., phenological response to climate change, genetic variation), sufficient data were available to evaluate all 117 species. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were highly dependent on size of assessment area and climate scenario selection. In addition, several ecological traits common in, but relatively unique to, herpetofauna are likely to contribute to their vulnerability and need special consideration during the scoring process. Despite some limitations, the NatureServe CCVI was a useful tool for screening large numbers of reptile and amphibian species. We provide general recommendations as to how the CCVI tool's application to herpetofauna can be improved through more specific guidance to the user regarding how to incorporate unique physiological and behavioral traits into scoring existing sensitivity factors and through modification to the assessment tool itself."
"Baseline plasma corticosterone, haematological and biochemical results in nesting and rehabilitating loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta)","The evaluation of hormonal responses to stress in reptiles relies on acquisition of baseline corticosterone concentrations; however, the stress associated with the restraint needed to collect the blood samples can affect the results. The purpose of this study was to determine a time limit for the collection of blood samples to evaluate baseline corticosterone, haematological and biochemical results in nesting (n = 11) and rehabilitating (n = 16) loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Blood samples were collected from the dorsal cervical sinus of each turtle immediately after touching the animal (t0; 0–3 min) and 3 (t3; 3–6 min), 6 (t6; 6–9 min; nesting turtles only), 10 (t10; 10–13 min) and 30 min (t30; rehabilitating turtles only) after the initial hands-on time. Consistent between the rehabilitating and nesting turtles, there was a subtle yet significant increase in white blood cell counts over time. Despite the fact that white blood cell counts increased during the sampling period, there was no direct correlation between white blood cell count and corticosterone in the sampled turtles. In the nesting turtles, significant elevations in corticosterone were noted between t0 and t3 (P = 0.014) and between t0 and t6 (P = 0.022). Values at t10 were not significantly different from those at t0 (P = 0.102); however, there was a trend for the corticosterone values to continue to increase. These results suggest that sampling of nesting loggerhead sea turtles within 3 min of handling will provide baseline corticosterone concentrations in their natural environment. Significant elevations in corticosterone were also noted in the rehabilitating loggerhead sea turtles between t0 and t10 (P = 0.02) and between t0 and t30 of sampling (P = 0.0001). These results suggest that sampling of loggerhead sea turtles within 6 min of handling should provide baseline corticosterone concentrations in a rehabilitation setting. The delay in the corticosterone response noted in the rehabilitating turtles may be associated with the daily contact (visual or direct) they have with their human caretaker"
