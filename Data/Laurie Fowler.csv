A test of porous pavement effectiveness on clay soils during natural storm events,"Porous pavements allow precipitation to infiltrate through the pavement to the soil, reducing the volume of stormwater runoff produced at a site. However, porous pavements are not widely used on fine-grained soils due to concerns about their performance. Our objective was to investigate the efficacy of porous pavements in controlling stormwater runoff on clay soils. We compared the performance of an asphalt parking lot and a porous pavement parking lot of grass pavers in Athens, Georgia, USA, over relatively small and low-intensity rain events. The porous lot produced 93% less runoff than the asphalt lot. The total volume of runoff at the porous lot was significantly less than the asphalt lot (t=2.96, p=0.009). Turbidity was significantly greater at the asphalt lot (t=6.18, p<0.001) whereas conductivity was significantly higher at the porous lot (t=2.31, p=0.03). Metal and nutrient concentrations were below detection limits at both lots during seven of nine small storm events. During events in which we could detect pollutants, calcium, zinc, silica, and total phosphorus concentrations were higher at the asphalt lot whereas total nitrogen concentrations were greater at the porous lot. Our results suggest porous pavements are a viable option for reducing stormwater runoff and some pollutants from small storms or the first flush from large storms on clay soils."
Regulation of Injected Ground Water Tracers,"Ground water tracer tests are routinely performed to estimate aquifer flow and transport properties, including the determination of well capture zones, hydrogeologic parameters, and contaminant travel times. Investigators may be unaware of tracer test reporting requirements and may fail to notify their regulatory agency prior to conducting tracer tests. The injection of tracers falls under the jurisdiction of the federal Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, which regulates the introduction of substances into underground sources of drinking water as part of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The UIC program is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by states with EPA‐approved programs. The federal UIC program requires that tracer tests must not endanger underground sources of drinking water, and all tracer tests must be reported prior to injection. We contacted the UIC program administrator for every state in early 1997. Some states report having more stringent requirements, while some states do not meet minimum federal requirements. Although the primary responsibility for ground water tracer selection and use rests on the investigator, national guidance is required to assure compliance with the UIC program. To assist investigators, we present acceptable tracers that have been identified by two states, Nevada and South Carolina, that require no further regulatory review."
CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION ORDINANCES,"Today in Georgia, residential development is almost synonymous with sprawl. Across the state, farmland and natural areas are bulldozed to construct single-family homes on as large a lot as the buyer can afford. Open space vanishes as developers strive to maximize the number of homes that can be subdivided out of a property. While this pattern of development has proven financially successful, an increasing number of homebuyers are asking for something different—a way of building that protects natural green space and is less environmentally destructive. This desire for an alternative has led to the development of conservation subdivisions. Local governments are responding to the demand by passing ordinances to give developers the flexibility and incentives to build this type of environmentally-sensitive housing. Some regulations have proven more successful than others, however, and this tool draws from these experiences to give local officials the information they need to develop effective conservation subdivision ordinances."
Conservation Easements for Natural Resource Protection,"A conservation easement is a legally binding agreement between a property owner and a governmental body or a land trust that restricts the type and amount of development and use that may take place on the property. (The land trust,1 a non-profit corporation whose purpose includes acquiring and holding land and interests in land for conservation purposes, must be recognized as a publicly-supported charitable organization by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS]). Conservation easements can be an effective complement to government acquisition programs and the regulation of uses to protect environmentally sensitive land. In 1992 the Georgia legislature passed the Uniform conservation Easement Act, which authorizes and promotes the use of conservation easements in Georgia.2 Ownership of land includes a ""bundle"" of rights - including the right to subdivide, to sell, to farm, to cut timber, and to build. A landowner may voluntarily agree to give up one or more of these rights in order to protect a resource or conservation value. For example, he might agree to prohibit any structures, roads, or clearcutting on a parcel in order to protect wildlife habitat. Or he might restrict land disturbance and chemical application within a river or lakeshore buffer zone, or restrict dredging in a wetland. In addition, he may reserve an number of basic rights - to sell, lease, assign and use the property; to restrict public access; to maintain the land for agricultural use subject to specified best management practices; or to construct additional dwellings on specified sites, for example. Under no condition may these reserved rights impair the resource or conservation value the easement seeks to protect. The agreement restricting and reserving certain uses is binding on future purchasers of the property and is recorded as a Deed of Conservation Easement. It is the responsibility of the easement holder (the government or the land trust) to routinely monitor the property, usually once a year, to ensure that the agreement is not violated and to pursue legal recourse to compel compliance if necessary. The land trust creates and maintains a stewardship fund to cover the costs for perpetual maintenance of the easement. To ensure that they put their limited resources to the best use, most land trust develop written criteria to guide them in determining whether to ursue or accept an easement.3"
Examining the Effects of Ecological and Political Boundaries on the Potential for Water Quality Trading: Lessons from a Southeastern Trading Framework,"Water quality trading (trading) as a means to improve water quality has become an increasingly popular instrument considered by environmental policy makers. Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists more than forty current trading programs in the U.S., only a few active markets exist. The literature identifies several hurdles to trading, overcoming which requires a deeper understanding of the interaction between local environmental, legal, and economic conditions. Particular challenges include thin markets, uncertainty related to the course and fate of nutrient flows, varying degrees of political support, and high transaction costs related to market infrastructure, monitoring, and enforcement. These hindrances often arise from and contribute to the confinement of trading to tight ecological and political boundaries. This paper explores the effect of these boundaries on the potential for trading in two southeastern reservoirs and their respective watersheds. Results provide insight into the effects of the spatial expansion of markets. These findings contribute to the current dialogue that seeks to better understand barriers to trading."
